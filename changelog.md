***Changelog 0.0.02***

Additions:
*Selecting options from the main menu now gives you a limited set of graphic options.
*The HUD now has an animated health bar.
*Added the first weapon, a metal pipe. Ordinarily it wouldn't be accessible until the next section but its enabled right away in the current build.
So you can smack things if you want.
*Added a flashlight pickup. After you pick up the flashlight you can toggle it on and off using the F key.

Known Issues:
*The pipe can currently be swung while text boxes and menus are active.
*Graphics options set in the menu are not persistent beyond the menu scene.
*I'm having a lot of issues with Unity's lighting currently. Hopefully the next Unity release really will have improved lighting options.

Planned For Next Release:
*Expanded functionality for the melee system: a "thrust" attack as well as a block ability. Preventing the pipe from swinging while in text boxes and menus.
*Creating a serializable class to store and load graphic settings set in the main menu. Expanding available graphic options.
